Group: Maiken Berthelsen, Ida Sandsbraaten and Sigrid Wanvik Haugen.




### Running instructions
Make sure that the folder containing the .csv files are in the same folder as main.py.

The code can be run by calling "python main.py" from your terminal.

Her bør vi legge til noe som printes til terminal når det er ferdig

The submission csv file can be found in the same folder.




### Code architecture
This code contains the following files:
* main.py 

	The whole code can be executed by running main.py. This file imports helpers.py and implementations.py

* helpers.py

	Contains the given functions for loading csv, predicting labels and create a csv submission.

* implementations.py

	Contains all of our implementations and is divided into three parts, such as

		- The six ML methods that are asked for in the project description.

		- The functions for data processing.

		- Contains the functions used in the ML methods.
